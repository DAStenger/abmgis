# Chapter 1 - Agent-based Modelling and Geographical Information Systems

This folder includes the accompanying resources for the chatper. For full book details, see: [http://www.abmgis.org/](http://www.abmgis.org/).

The overarching aim of this chapter is to give the reader a contextual background and general overview of the major developments in geographical modelling for the simulation of the individual.  The reader is introduced to a discussion around the purpose of modelling as well how complexity theory has influenced the way that we view (and simulate) geographical systems.  We end the chapter by discussing the benefits of bringing together agent-based modelling and GIS.
