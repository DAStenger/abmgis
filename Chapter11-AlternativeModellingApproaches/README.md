##Introduction

Agent-based modelling is one of the most popular approaches used in social and spatial simulation.  However, there are several other alternative approaches that are available to the researcher including Cellular Automata, Microsimulation, Discreet Event Simulation, System Dynamics and Spatial Interaction models. This chapter presents an overview of these other approaches giving simple examples on how they can be used and summarising the main differences between them.  To compare these models, they are applied to the same issue, the spread of a disease using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model.  This shows that while the same general patterns emerge, the reasons for this are very different.
