# Chapter 11 - Alternative Modelling Approaches

This folder includes the accompanying resources for the chatper. For full book details, see: [http://www.abmgis.org/](http://www.abmgis.org/).

## Introduction

Agent-based modelling is one of the most popular approaches used in social and spatial simulation.  However, there are several other alternative approaches that are available to the researcher including Cellular Automata (CA), Microsimulation, Discreet Event Simulation (DES), System Dynamics (SD) and Spatial Interaction models. 

This chapter presents an overview of these other approaches giving simple examples on how they can be used and summarising the main differences between them.  To compare these models, they are applied to the same issue, the spread of a disease using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model.  This shows that while the same general patterns emerge, the reasons for this are very different.

## This Directory

You will find 3 example models of for CA, SD and DES. 

1. **A Cellular Automata** (CA) model: The Game of Life model ([CA_LifeModifed_Example.nlogo](Models/CA_LifeModifed_Example.nlogo))
1. **A Discreet Event Simulation** (DES): [DES_Airport_Queue_Example.nlogo](Models/DES_Airport_Queue_Example.nlogo)
1. **A System Dynamics** (SD) Model: [System_Dynamics_Wolf_Sheep_Predation_Example.nlogo](Models/System_Dynamics_Wolf_Sheep_Predation_Example.nlogo)

More details about these models can be found [here](Models/README.md) 

Furthermore, to compare the differnet modeling approaches to the same issue, in this directory you will also find 4 models that look at the spread of a disease:

* **Cellular Automata** ([SIR_CA.nlogo](Models/SIR_Models/SIR_CA.nlogo))
* **Discreet Event Simulation** ([SIR_DES.nlogo](Models/SIR_Models/SIR_DES.nlogo))
* **System Dynamics Model** ([SIR_SD.nlogo](Models/SIR_Models/SIR_SD.nlogo))
* **Agent-based Model** ([SIR_ABM.nlogo](Models/SIR_Models/SIR_ABM.nlogo))

More details about these models can be found [here](Models/SIR_Models/README.md)
