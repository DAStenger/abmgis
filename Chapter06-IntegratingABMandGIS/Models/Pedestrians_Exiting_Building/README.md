# Pedestrians Exiting Building

## Introduction

This model builds upon the [Rainfall Model](../Rainfall) and the [**Pedestrian_Model_Grid**](../Pedestrian_Model_Grid)

we show a more complicated configuration based on a floor plan that has been first converted from a CAD file to a Shapefile  before being converted into a raster where each cell is 50cm by 50cm that can then be used in the NetLogo model (coming soon there will be a bunch of tutorials on how we do this).


ortunately it is relatively straight forward to use NetLogo to include GIS data in a pedestrian model, as illustrated in Figure 6.9. In that example, an architectâ€™s CAD file (a file format used by AutoCad) of a building on the George Mason University Fairfax campus is used. It is possible to geo-reference the building to its actual real-world location and then rasterize the space so that each cell represents approximately 50cm2.
