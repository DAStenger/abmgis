## Introduction

This model builds upon the [**Rainfall Model**](../Rainfall) and the [**Pedestrian_Model_Grid**](../Pedestrian_Model_Grid) to show a more complicated configuration based on a floor plan that has been first converted from a CAD file to a Shapefile  before being converted into a raster where each cell is 50cm by 50cm that can then be used in the NetLogo model.

Below is the graphical user interface of the model:
