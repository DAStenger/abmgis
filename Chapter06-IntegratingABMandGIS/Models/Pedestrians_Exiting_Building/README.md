## Introduction

we show a more complicated configuration based on a floor plan that has been first converted from a CAD file to a Shapefile  before being converted into a raster where each cell is 50cm by 50cm that can then be used in the NetLogo model (coming soon there will be a bunch of tutorials on how we do this).
