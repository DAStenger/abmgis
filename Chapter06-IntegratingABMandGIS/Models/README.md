## Introduction

In the folder you will find:

* [**PatchSize Model**](PatchSize): An example of setting the patch size of NetLogo 
* **[UrbanGrowth](UrbanGrowth)**: The model demonstrates how several raster layers can be used to initialize a NetLogo model and explore urban growth.
* **[Rainfall Model](Rainfall)**: An exaple of how to use a digital elevation model (DEM) and make agents follow a gradient. 
	* [**RainFall_3D**](RainFall_3D): An extension of the rainfall model to 3D (using Netlogo 3D.
* [**Pedestrian_Model_Grid**](Pedestrian_Model_Grid): Simple example of agents following a gradient to exit a room.
* [**Pedestrians_Exiting_Building**](Pedestrians_Exiting_Building): Simple pedestrian evacauion model based on a CAD file.
* [**Segregation_DC_1**](Segregation_DC_1): Segregation model where each vector polygon is an agent.
* [**Segregation_DC_2**](Segregation_DC_2): Builds on Segregation_DC_1 but has multiple agents per polygon.
