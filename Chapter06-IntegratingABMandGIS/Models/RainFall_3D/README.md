## Introduction

This model extends the [**Rainfall Model**](../Rainfall) by using a text file to create a 3D terrian. In order for this to work we have a breed called ```stayers``` which ```spout``` from the patches which have infromation from the text file (and inherit the inforamtion from them). These ```stayers``` are then linked togehter to for the 3D terrain. 

Below is the graphical user interface of the model:
