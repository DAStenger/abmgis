# Chapter 2 - Introduction to Agent-based Modelling

This folder includes the accompanying resources for the chatper. For full book details, see: [http://www.abmgis.org/](http://www.abmgis.org/).

In this Chapter we introduce the key concepts behind agent-based modelling.  What is an agent, and what are rules?  These are discussed along with a consideration of the main advantages and disadvantages for simulating spatial systems.  A range of established applications are presented to give a flavour of how agent-based models can be successfully applied.  The overarching aim of this chapter is to give the reader an understanding of what an agent-based model is.  This knowledge will be built upon in subsequent chapters. 

Within this folder you will find:

* A [powerpoint](https://github.com/abmgis/abmgis/blob/master/Chapter02-IntroToABM/Chapter2.pptx) to act as a teaching aid for this chapter (with links to other online resources)
* [A selection of models to highlight core concepts](/Models):
