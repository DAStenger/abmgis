# Chapter 9 - Spatial Statistics: Resources

Within this folder you will find:

   * An [R Markdown](statistics.Rmd) file that is used to generate all of the graphs and most of the maps;
   * The [ArcMap document](GIStar.mxd) that was used to run and display the GI* analysis;
   * The publicly available [crime data](data) that are used to create the examples.
