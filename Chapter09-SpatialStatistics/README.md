# Chapter 9 - Spatial Statistics

This chapter presents a range of statistics and algorithms that can be used to compare two spatial data sets. These are important for modelling because, at some point, it will be necessary to compare a model outcome to some real-world data in order to assess how reliable the model is. This chapter examines the statistics themselves, before [Chapter 10](../Chapter10-EvaluatingModels) elaborates on how to evaluate the success of a model more broadly, part of which includes making use of the methods discussed here.

Within this folder you will find:

* A [powerpoint](./Chapter9.pptx) to act as a teaching aid for this chapter (with links to other online resources)
* [Resources](./Resources) that can be used to perform some of the statistical analyses described in the chapter. These include:

   * An [R Markdown](./Resources/statistics.Rmd) file that is used to generate all of the graphs and most of the maps
   * The [ArcMap document](./Resources/GIStar.mxd) that was used to run and display the GI* analysis.
   * The publicly available [crime data](./Resources/data) that are used to create the examples
