# A.4 The Foothill Yellow-legged Frog Assessment Model (FYFAM)




## Introduction

The Foothill Yellow-legged Frog Assessment Model (FYFAM) developed in NetLogo by Railsback et al. (2015) explores how water temperature and flows impact the foothill yellow-legged frog (*Rana boylii*) breeding success in Californian rivers and streams which is shown in below. Unlike other frog species, the foothill yellow-legged frog (FLF) breeds in rivers and streams and not still water thus eggs and tadpoles are vulnerable to changes in water conditions which impacted by upstream, reservoirs. The model provides an environment to explore the reproductive successes of FLF under various flow realise policies from a dam.
