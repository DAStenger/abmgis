# Appendix A12 - Agent-Based Modeling of Conflict Diamonds





## Introduction

In the early 1990s, Sierra Leone entered into nearly 10 years of civil war. The ease of accessibility to the country's diamonds is said to have provided the funding needed to sustain the insurgency over the years. According to Le Billon (2001), the spatial dispersion of a resource is a major defining feature of a war. Pires and Crooks  (2016), developed an agent-based model in MASON using geographic information  to create a realistic landscape and theory to ground agent behaviour to explore Le Billon's (2001) claim. The GUI of the model is shown in Figure below. Different scenarios were explored as the diamond mines are made secure and the mining areas were moved from rural areas to the capital. They found that unexpected consequences can come from minimally increasing security when the mining sites are in rural regions, potentially displacing conflict rather than removing it. On the other hand, minimal security may be sufficient to prevent conflict when resources are found in the city.
