# # Appendix A7 - Walk this Way




## Introduction

Pedestrian modelling has been traditionally faced with the challenge of collecting data to calibrate and validate such models of pedestrian movement. With the increased availability of mobility datasets fromvideo surveillance we are now presented with the opportunity to change the way we build pedestrian models. Using MASON, Crooks *et al.* (2015) demonstrated how real scene activity information can be harvested and used in agent-based models as shown in the Figure below to better inform pedestrian models and enhance their predictive capabilities.
