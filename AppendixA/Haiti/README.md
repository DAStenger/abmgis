# Appendix A8 - Natural Disasters and Humanitarian Relief




## Introduction

Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis occur all over the world, altering the physical landscape and often severely disrupting people?s daily lives. Recently researchers? attention has focused on using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and devastation caused by natural disasters.

While such data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess damage and thus aid the distribution ofrelief, it tells us little about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. In the model developed shown in the Figure below by Crooks and Wise (2013) using MASON and data from several different sources (e.g. OpenStreetMap), they demonstrate how crowdsourced geographic information can be used to study the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The specic case modelled here was the Haiti earthquake of January 2010. The model demonstrates the importance of exploring of human-environment interactions and the positioning of aid centres after a natural disaster and how different aid centre configurations impact the health of the surviving population.
