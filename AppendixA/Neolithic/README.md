# A.6 The Spread of Agriculture during the Neolithic period




## Introduction

Gordo *et al.* (2015) developed a spatially explicit CA model in NetLogo to explore the spread of agriculture in Iberian Peninsula during the Neolithic period. Specifically they classified the landscape (i.e. the cells) based on its suitability for agriculture at a 5 by 5 km resolution as shown in the Figure below. They then tested different models of dispersal (e.g. agriculture spreads from one cell to its dispersal as long as the conditions are suitable for agriculture etc.). By doing so the researchers were able to explore how different starting points for agriculture correlated to actual archeological records.
