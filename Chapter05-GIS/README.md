# Chapter 5 - Fundamentals of Geographical Information Systems

This folder includes the accompanying resources for the chatper. For full book details, see: [http://www.abmgis.org/](http://www.abmgis.org/).

## Introduction

This chapter presents the main concepts and terminology that students are required to understand geographical information systems. The main data types are presented, along with a discussion of relevant issues such as accuracy and precision. A brief overview of the development of GIS is given along with a flavour of the main software available. Using QGIS, we demonstrate how to prepare and manipulate some example GIS data. Where appropriate, we highlight the main issues that need to be considered when using a GIS and agent-based modelling.


Within the folder you will find:

* A simple NetLogo Model ([**ImportRasterSample**](Models/RasterExample)) which demostrates reading in raster data and creating a landscape.
* Data used for Performing Spatial Operations [on the **Uganda Example**](Models/UgandaExample) and the reuslting agent-based model ([**UgandaExample**](Models/UgandaExample)) 
* Data used to add a new column to a attribute table that underpins a vector layer using QGIS based on [**Washington DC.**](Data/DC_Data).
